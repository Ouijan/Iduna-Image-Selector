# Iduna Image Selector
Javascript form input transformer. Creates an interactive gallery style image selector. 
Given an array of images and their values, Iduna will transform the input element into a button that trigger a popup (modal) where the user can select image(s). The selected image's values are stored in the now hidden input element ready for form submission, etc.
